## Overview
This repository is focused on exploring and implementing core concepts of reinforcement learning. The projects range from beginner-friendly environments to more advanced applications and experiments, designed to deepen understanding of RL algorithms and techniques.

## Project List
The following are some of the key projects included in this repository:
1. **Taxi-v3 Solver using Q-Learning**
   - Environment: Taxi-v3 (OpenAI Gym)
   - Algorithm: Q-Learning
   - Focus: Navigation, Optimal Policy Search

## Q-Learning Algorithm

Q-learning is a popular model-free off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm. It seeks to find the optimal policy that maximizes the cumulative reward by learning action values, or Q-values, for each state-action pair.

### Q-Learning Formula:

The Q-Learning update rule is given by:

$$
\
Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \left( r_{t+1} + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s_{t+1}, a') - Q(s_t, a_t) \right)
\
$$

Where:
- \($ Q(s_t, a_t) $) is the Q-value for the state \($ s_t$ \) and action \($ a_t$ \)
- \( $\alpha $\) is the learning rate
- \( $r_{t+1}\ $) is the reward received after taking action \($ a_t $\)
- \($ \gamma\ $) is the discount factor (how much we value future rewards)
- \( $\max_{a'} Q(s_{t+1}, a')$ \) is the estimated optimal future reward from the next state \($ s_{t+1} \ $)

## How We Solved Taxi-v3

**Taxi-v3** is a discrete environment where the agent's goal is to pick up passengers and drop them off at the correct destination in a grid world. The agent can move in four directions (north, south, east, west) or pick up/drop off the passenger.

We use Q-learning to solve this environment by training the agent to maximize cumulative rewards. The agent learns through trial and error by exploring different states and actions, then updating the Q-table according to the Q-learning update rule. Once trained, the agent uses the learned policy to efficiently navigate the grid.

### Steps:
1. **State Space**: There are 500 discrete states representing the taxi position, passenger location, and destination.
2. **Action Space**: 6 discrete actions (move in four directions, pick up, drop off).
3. **Reward**: The agent receives +20 for successfully dropping off the passenger, -1 for each step taken, and -10 for illegal actions (like dropping off the passenger at the wrong place).

During training, the agent explores the environment using an epsilon-greedy strategy. Over time, the Q-values converge, and the agent learns the optimal policy.
